    "### Machine Learning Regression Module - Standard ML Project Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This module covers Regression and the standard steps needed to implement an ML project. Below are the key steps we follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Preparation/Cleaning\n",
    "This step includes handling missing values and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imputation Methods:**\n",
    "- **Mean/Median Imputation:** Filling in missing values with either the average (mean) or middle value (median) of that variable\n",
    "  - Use mean for normally distributed data\n",
    "  - Use median for skewed data or when outliers are present\n",
    "\n",
    "- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation:** A more sophisticated approach that finds similar data points (neighbors) and uses their values to estimate missing values\n",
    "  - Preserves relationships between variables\n",
    "  - More accurate than simple mean/median\n",
    "  - Computationally more expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Integration\n",
    "If multiple related datasets exist, merge them into a single dataset based on common identifiers (keys). This creates a unified dataset for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Transformation\n",
    "Converting variables into suitable formats for analysis through feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common transformations:**\n",
    "- **One-Hot Encoding:** Converting categorical variables into binary columns (for nominal categories)\n",
    "- **Label Encoding:** Converting categorical variables into numerical labels (for ordinal categories)\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new variables that might have better relationships with target variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Feature Scaling\n",
    "Standardizing or normalizing the range of features so they're on a similar scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:**\n",
    "Many algorithms use distance calculations or gradient descent, which are sensitive to feature magnitude. Without scaling, features with larger ranges dominate the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Feature 1: Age (20-80)\n",
    "- Feature 2: Income (20,000-200,000)\n",
    "- Income would disproportionately influence the model due to its larger scale\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Scaling Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)\n",
    "- Scales features to range [0, 1]\n",
    "- Formula: (x - min) / (max - min)\n",
    "- **Use when:** You need bounded values and don't have outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Standardization (Z-score Normalization)\n",
    "- Transforms data to mean=0, standard deviation=1\n",
    "- Formula: (x - mean) / standard deviation\n",
    "- **Use when:** Data is normally distributed or has outliers (more robust)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Robust Scaling\n",
    "- Uses median and interquartile range\n",
    "- Less affected by outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "**When scaling is needed:**\n",
    "- Distance-based algorithms: KNN, K-means, SVM\n",
    "- Gradient descent algorithms: Neural networks, linear/logistic regression\n",
    "- Algorithms with regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "**When scaling is NOT needed:**\n",
    "- Tree-based models: Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Train-Validation-Test Split\n",
    "Split the dataset into three parts for model building and evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training set:** 60% - used to train the model\n",
    "- **Validation set:** 20% - used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting\n",
    "- **Test set:** 20% - used for final model evaluation (untouched until the end)"

    "### What is EDA?\n",
    "EDA is exploring your data to understand it better before building models. It's like getting to know your data first!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do EDA?\n",
    "- Find patterns and trends\n",
    "- Understand relationships between variables\n",
    "- Spot problems in the data\n",
    "- Make better decisions about next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Main Parts of EDA:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Summary Statistics\n",
    "Calculate basic numbers to understand your data:\n",
    "- **Mean** - average value\n",
    "- **Median** - middle value\n",
    "- **Standard deviation** - how spread out the data is\n",
    "\n",
    "These help you spot outliers and understand data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Visualizations\n",
    "Create graphs to see patterns visually:\n",
    "- **Histograms** - show data distribution\n",
    "- **Scatter plots** - show relationships between two variables\n",
    "- **Box plots** - show spread and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations make it easier to spot patterns you might miss in numbers alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Data Cleaning\n",
    "Fix problems in your dataset:\n",
    "- Handle missing values (fill them in or remove them)\n",
    "- Deal with outliers (unusual values)\n",
    "- Fix inconsistencies or errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Point:\n",
    "EDA is **iterative** - you keep exploring as you learn more about your data. Each discovery may lead to new questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bottom Line:\n",
    "EDA is the foundation of any data project. It helps you understand your data before you analyze it or build models."

    "#### The Math Problem\n",
    "#### Understanding Matrix Inverses\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inverse (X⁻¹) is like \"division\" for matrices\n",
    "    When you multiply a matrix by its inverse: X × X⁻¹ = I (Identity matrix)\n",
    "    Similar to how 5 × 1/5 = 1 in regular math\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Square Matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix where number of rows = number of columns\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "2×2 matrix ✓ (square)\n",
    "3×3 matrix ✓ (square)\n",
    "1000×3 matrix ✗ (NOT square - 1000 rows, 3 columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why X⁻¹ Doesn't Work for Our Data\n",
    "\n",
    "    X⁻¹ only exists for square matrices\n",
    "    Our feature matrix X is usually m × (n+1) - NOT square\n",
    "\n",
    "    m = number of observations (e.g., 1000 cars)\n",
    "    n+1 = number of features (e.g., 3 features)\n",
    "    Example: 1000 rows × 3 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-square matrices change dimensions → can't be reversed/inverted\n",
    "It's mathematically impossible to create X⁻¹ for rectangular matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Gram Matrix Solution\n",
    "Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "Step 1: What is Xᵀ (X Transpose)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Transpose means flipping rows and columns\n",
    "If X has dimensions 1000×3 (1000 rows, 3 columns)\n",
    "Then Xᵀ has dimensions 3×1000 (3 rows, 1000 columns)\n",

    "Matrix multiplication rule: (a×b) × (b×c) = (a×c)\n",
    "Result: 3×3 matrix (SQUARE! ✓)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why This Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "The middle dimensions (1000) must match for multiplication\n",
    "The outer dimensions (3 and 3) become the result's dimensions\n",
    "We always get a square matrix!\n",
    "\n",
    "General Pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "If X is m×n (any rectangular matrix)\n",
    "Then Xᵀ is n×m\n",
