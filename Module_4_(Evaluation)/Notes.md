## ROC AUC Feature Importance

### What is ROC AUC?
- **ROC** = Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
- **AUC** = Area Under the Curve
- Measures how well a feature can distinguish between two classes (converted vs not converted)
- Score ranges from 0 to 1
  - 0.5 = random guessing (no predictive power)
  - 1.0 = perfect prediction
  - Below 0.5 = negative correlation (feature works backwards)

### Using AUC for Feature Importance
- Each numerical feature can be treated as a "prediction score"
- Calculate AUC using the feature values as predictions
- Higher AUC = more important feature
- Features with AUC > 0.5 are positively correlated with target
- Features with AUC < 0.5 are negatively correlated with target

### Negative Correlation
- If AUC < 0.5, the feature predicts the opposite of what we want
- Solution: Invert the feature (multiply by -1)
- After inverting, negative correlation becomes positive
- This allows fair comparison of all features

### Why This Matters
- Helps identify which features are most predictive
- Allows you to focus on important variables
- Can guide feature engineering and selection
- Simple way to understand feature-target relationships


## Precision and Recall

### What is a Threshold?
- Models output probabilities (0 to 1)
- We need to convert probabilities to yes/no decisions
- Threshold is the cutoff point (e.g., if probability > 0.5, predict yes)
- Different thresholds give different predictions

### Precision
- **Question it answers**: "Of all the people we predicted would convert, how many actually did?"
- **Formula concept**: Correct positive predictions / All positive predictions
- **High precision** = Few false alarms
- **Example**: If precision is 0.8, then 80% of our positive predictions are correct

### Recall
- **Question it answers**: "Of all the people who actually converted, how many did we catch?"
- **Formula concept**: Correct positive predictions / All actual positives
- **High recall** = We don't miss many opportunities
- **Example**: If recall is 0.7, we caught 70% of all actual converters

### The Trade-off
- **High threshold** (e.g., 0.8):
  - Only predict "yes" when very confident
  - High precision (few mistakes)
  - Low recall (miss many opportunities)
  
- **Low threshold** (e.g., 0.2):
  - Predict "yes" more liberally
  - Low precision (many false alarms)
  - High recall (catch most opportunities)

### Precision-Recall Intersection
- The point where precision equals recall
- Represents a natural balance point
- Neither metric is favored over the other
- Useful reference point for threshold selection

### When to Favor Each
- **Favor Precision**: When false positives are costly
  - Example: Spam detection (don't block important emails)
  - Example: Approving loans (don't approve bad loans)

- **Favor Recall**: When false negatives are costly
  - Example: Disease detection (don't miss sick patients)
  - Example: Fraud detection (don't miss fraudulent transactions)



## F1 Score

### What is F1?
- A single metric that combines precision and recall
- Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Ranges from 0 to 1 (higher is better)
- Balances both metrics equally

### Why F1 is Useful
- Single number instead of tracking two metrics
- Both precision and recall must be high for good F1
- If either precision or recall is very low, F1 will be low
- Prevents gaming the system by optimizing only one metric

### How It Works
- If precision = 0.8 and recall = 0.8, then F1 = 0.8 (perfect balance)
- If precision = 0.9 and recall = 0.5, then F1 = 0.64 (penalized for imbalance)
- If precision = 1.0 and recall = 0.1, then F1 = 0.18 (heavily penalized)

### Finding Optimal Threshold with F1
- Calculate F1 score at many different thresholds
- The threshold with highest F1 gives the best balance
- This is your "optimal" operating point
- Common approach when precision and recall are equally important

### When to Use F1
- When you care equally about precision and recall
- When you need a single metric for model comparison
- When dealing with imbalanced datasets
- General-purpose performance metric

### When NOT to Use F1
- When precision and recall have different importance
- When business requirements clearly favor one over the other
- When you need to understand the trade-off in detail



## K-Fold Cross-Validation

### The Problem with Single Split
- One train/validation split might be lucky or unlucky
- Performance could vary based on which data points ended up in validation
- Single number might be misleading

### How K-Fold Works
- Split data into K equal parts (folds)
- **Round 1**: Train on folds 2,3,4,5 → Test on fold 1
- **Round 2**: Train on folds 1,3,4,5 → Test on fold 2
- **Round 3**: Train on folds 1,2,4,5 → Test on fold 3
- Continue for all K rounds
- Each data point is used for validation exactly once

### Benefits
- **More reliable estimate**: Average performance across K models
- **Use all data**: Every point used for both training and validation
- **Understand variability**: See how consistent the model is
- **Better confidence**: Less dependent on lucky/unlucky splits

### Understanding the Results
- **Mean score**: Average performance across all folds
- **Standard deviation**: How much performance varies
  - Low std = consistent, reliable model
  - High std = unstable, unpredictable model

### Common K Values
- **K=5**: Good balance, commonly used
- **K=10**: More thorough, takes longer
- **K=3**: Faster, less thorough
- Larger K = more computation but more reliable estimate

### Important Parameters
- **shuffle=True**: Randomly mix data before splitting
- **random_state**: Makes results reproducible
- Without shuffling, might get biased folds

### When to Use Cross-Validation
- Comparing different models
- Tuning hyperparameters
- When you have limited data
- When you need reliable performance estimates


## Hyperparameter Tuning

### What are Hyperparameters?
- Settings you choose BEFORE training
- Not learned from data
- Examples: learning rate, regularization strength, tree depth
- Different from model parameters (weights/coefficients learned during training)

### What is Regularization (C parameter)?
- Prevents overfitting (model memorizing training data)
- Encourages simpler, more general models
- **C parameter** controls regularization strength:
  - Large C (e.g., 100): Weak regularization → Complex model, might overfit
  - Small C (e.g., 0.001): Strong regularization → Simple model, might underfit

### The Tuning Process
- Try different hyperparameter values
- Use cross-validation to evaluate each one fairly
- Compare average performance
- Select the best hyperparameter value

### How to Select Best Hyperparameter
1. **First priority**: Highest mean performance
   - Choose the hyperparameter with best average score

2. **If tied**: Lowest standard deviation
   - More consistent = more reliable
   - Prefer stable model over lucky model

3. **Still tied**: Simplest model
   - Smaller C = simpler model
   - Occam's Razor: simpler is better when performance is equal

### Why This Order?
- Performance matters most (that's the goal!)
- Consistency prevents surprises in production
- Simplicity reduces overfitting risk

### Grid Search vs Random Search
- **Grid Search**: Try all combinations systematically
  - Thorough but slow
  - Good for few hyperparameters

- **Random Search**: Try random combinations
  - Faster
  - Good for many hyperparameters

### Common Pitfalls
- Testing on training data (overfitting!)
- Not using cross-validation (unreliable results)
- Tuning too many hyperparameters (overfitting to validation set)
- Forgetting about computational cost

### Best Practices
- Always use cross-validation for tuning
- Start with wide range, then narrow down
- Consider computational budget
- Don't overfit to validation set
- Keep test set completely separate until final evaluation


## Quick Comparison

| **Recall** | Coverage of actual positives | When false negatives are costly |
| **F1** | Balance of precision and recall | When both matter equally |

## Key Insights

### Model Evaluation
- Use cross-validation for reliable estimates
- Mean score shows average performance
- Standard deviation shows consistency
- Both matter for model selection

### Threshold Selection
- Different thresholds give different precision/recall
- F1 helps find optimal balance
- Business requirements should guide final choice

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Critical for model performance
- Requires systematic evaluation
- Cross-validation is essential
